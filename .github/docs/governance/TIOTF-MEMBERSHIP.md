# TIOTF Membership Policy

## 1. Membership Philosophy

The Tire Industry Open Technology Foundation (TIOTF) membership program is designed to:

- Encourage **early and generous participation** while remaining accessible to organizations of all sizes
- Respect the financial realities of a diverse industry ecosystem
- Preserve strict **vendor, sector, and technology neutrality**

All tiers are subject to the same governance rules and rights.

\* Final dues amounts, indexing, and currency are established annually by the Board of Directors.

## 3. Equal Governance Rights

To ensure neutrality and trust:

- All voting members receive **one (1) vote**
- All members may participate in committees and working groups
- All members are eligible for board service, subject to bylaws and term limits

**Membership tier or financial contribution shall not alter governance authority, voting rights, or technical influence.**

---

## 4. Founding & Early Member Program

Organizations joining TIOTF during its formative period may be designated as **Founding Members** or **Early Members**, as determined by the Board.

### Founding / Early Member Recognition

Recognition is **honorary and non-governing**, and may include:

- Permanent public recognition as a Founding Member
- Priority access to early-stage working groups and pilot initiatives
- Invitation to an annual **Founders Advisory Roundtable** (advisory only)

This recognition reflects early trust and commitment, not preferential control.

## 5. Fee Lock-In for Early Members

To reward early participation and provide financial predictability:

| Join Period | Fee Lock-In Benefit |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Year 1** | Membership dues locked for five (5) years |
| **Year 2** | Membership dues locked for three (3) years |
| **Thereafter** | Subject to standard annual indexing |

Fee lock-in applies to the member’s initial tier and does not alter governance rights.
